# Timer
Work and school timing-assistance tools
There are two versions of this- the console version, and the GUI version. Admittedly, I am inexperienced with Swing thus far- I learned it in a day just to make the second version. I need to learn better how to format all of these files in folders, but for some reason I can't just upload the whole project folder.
The GUI version uses the bell sound, TheGUI.java, SoundPlayer.java, Formatter.java, and Placeholder.java, with Placeholder.java as Main.
